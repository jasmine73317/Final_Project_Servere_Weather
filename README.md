# Final_Project_Servere_Weather

Web Application built to analyze and predict weather patterns via four categories:
  -Humidity (%)
  -Pressure (hPa)
  -Temperature (K)
  -Wind Speed (m/s)
  
Using 5 years of weather data from 30 cities, we built a collection of ML models for use in this full-stack application. 
A query is made to a database of this data, which then is fed into pre-trained models to provide the user with a table of predictions.
